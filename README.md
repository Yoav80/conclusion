## Welcome

Glad to see your first chat went well! This is the starter app for our little pair-programming test. Below is some information, you'll get all the relevant information at the time of your appointment, but it is good to clone the code and get a head start.

## Getting Started

To keep things simple, the app is built using the 'create-react-app' and hasn't been ejected. The following steps are required to get started:

1. Clone the project
   `git clone git@github.com:conclusion-digital-cx/Application.git`

2. Install dependencies
   `yarn install`

3. Run the project
   `yarn start`

## Some Info

This is a very basic app, we've included bootstrap for the CSS styles, but we haven't included jquery or any of the other dependencies Bootstrap requires. Please know that you will get a warning when installing the application, but that's fine. We're only importing the main bootstrap CSS :)

## Contributing

To close the loop, we would like you to create your own branch to work in and push to. The master branch will be locked and may not be pushed to.
